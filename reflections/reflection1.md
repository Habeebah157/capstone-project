## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Habeebah Muse worked really hard on the back end. She changed a csv file into sql tables that would be essential to the front end. Lucia Barboza really made the front end stand out. She worked on the landing page, about page, and the testimonial. She also implemented the nav bar. It looks amazing and clean. I, Angelica Ramirez, worked on the front end as well. This includes the login, registration, and the user preferences forms. With that being said, we are still planning to go back and make changes and tweaks to make the website looks as good as it can be.


* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Github. We always feel like we understand the pulling and pushing flow. We are still learning because we've had problems with it that have made us waste time, but other than that, everything is good.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes, this was the good thing about sprint one. We finished all our tasks. Obviously, like I said, we need to go back to polish and finalize our work, but the good thing is that we finished our goals, which feels really good. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on? 

Yes! Trello is amazing. We are still learning how to really break things down into more tasks to really integrate the things we need to get finished. Without any organizational skills and resources, we would not be where we are today. 



* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I don't think any features are at risk. We are on track and finished what we were supposed to be finished with this week. However, the front end for the user preferences form will be changed, but it will not interfere with this upcoming week's, sprint two, because I have the weekend to work on it.
