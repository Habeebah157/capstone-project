# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Angelica Ramirez, Habeebah Muse, Lucia Barboza**

## Problem Statement

The problem that our capstone pod would like to solve are the issues that come with relocating to a different place (city/state). People relocating lack the experience and the familiarity of the city or area to choose housing that is safe and aligns with their hobbies, values, and lifestyle. They lack knowledge or awareness and the sense of the area like the accessibility or public transportation. Our target audience are college students and interns.

## User Roles

“young adult” (ranges of 18-30) : a user who is seeking help with travelling

## User Personas

1
Rebecca Smith is from Dallas, Texas. Her hobbies include horseback riding, reading a book, and lots of coding. Rebecca also attends the University of Texas and is a computer science student. Rebecca is a first generation student and has big dreams of working in a big city. She's an introvert.

She is 20 years of age and she is an aspiring software engineering intern. She uses all types of tech devices such as her laptop, phone, etc. She might access the site whenever she is in the relocation process.

Rebecca’s motivation for using the app is that she wants to find a safe and comfortable place so that her family knows she is not in danger.

Potential pain points for Rebecca would be a slow web app, a not-so appealing interface, not having the implementation of the crime rate in the web app, an unorganized website rather than an all-in-one component web app.

2
Tom is a 25 year old college graduate who is working in his father’s company as a traveling consultant. Tom is from New York City and is excited to go on his first trip to Washington for business. Tom is a gym rat and is worried there won’t be any gyms near his housing.

He is not tech savvy. He does know how to use his phone well. He uses his laptop more to make Excel sheets. This means that the web app has to be really user friendly especially with the interface. Tom will have to use the web app a lot because he travels to different places almost twice a week.

Tom’s motivation for using the app is moving to another state for his father’s business. He wants to find safe housing and also weight-lifting gyms near the area.

Some potential pain points for Tom are if the web app is not a mobile app and if the interface isn’t easy to navigate.
